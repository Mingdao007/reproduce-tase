- Selected label: `ur10e_adapted_terminal_setup_diagnostic`
- Stitched gate pass: `True`
- Stage A gate pass: `True`
- Stage B handoff passes: `1 / 1`
- Stage A duration: `15.0`
- Stage B duration per trajectory: `2.0`
- Stage A max qdot: `0.11224745619902818`
- Stage A qdot saturation fraction: `0.0`

| `e2-figure-eight` | `True` | `none` | `0.000656466576185748` | `5.223253046544641e-07` | `0.10099329829600373` | `0.0` | `1.0` |

Interpretation:

- This is the first single-run diagnostic Stage A tracker plus Stage B handoff evaluation.
- It remains diagnostic-label simulation evidence, not strict paper-equivalent feasibility.
- It is not hardware-ready.
