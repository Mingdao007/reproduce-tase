| `e2-figure-eight` | `True` | `none` | `0.0016767741145377046` | `8.376098360624269e-07` | `0.08994614817444518` | `0.0` | `1.0` |

Interpretation:

- This is the first single-run diagnostic Stage A tracker plus Stage B handoff evaluation.
- It remains diagnostic-label simulation evidence, not strict paper-equivalent feasibility.
- It is not hardware-ready.
