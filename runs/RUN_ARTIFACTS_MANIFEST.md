# Run Artifacts Manifest

This repo tracks lightweight migrated run metadata and plots. Large raw arrays
and large nested worktrees remain in the legacy source unless Git LFS is later
configured.

Legacy source root:

`/home/andy/ur10e_ros2_ws/experiments/20260523_tase_finite_time_ur10e_mujoco_reproduction/runs/`

## Migrated Lightweight Runs

### Fig.5 scalar sweep

- Run: `runs/fig5_r_sweep/20260523T113301`
- Migrated: `metrics.yaml`, `metrics.json`, `fig5_r-sweep_20260523T113301.png`
- Omitted raw: `fig5_r-sweep_raw.npz`
- Status: legacy run, not yet re-run from this repo.

### Article-level synthetic E1-E4

- Run: `runs/full_article_experiments/20260523T114332`
- Migrated: metrics, CSV, summary Markdown, and PNG plots.
- Omitted raw: `article_experiments_raw.npz`
- Status: synthetic simulation reference, not PDF-verified paper truth.

### UR10e smoke

- Runs:
  - `runs/ur10e_smoke/20260523T113313`
  - `runs/ur10e_smoke/20260523T113341`
  - `runs/ur10e_smoke/20260523T113420`
- Migrated: metrics and PNG plots.
- Omitted raw: `ur10e-smoke_raw-state.npz`
- Status: legacy smoke runs, not yet re-run from this repo.

## New Repo Verification Runs

### Fig.5 scalar sweep

- Run: `runs/fig5_r_sweep/20260524T011145`
- Command:
  `python3 scripts/run_fig5_r_sweep.py --config configs/paper_truth.yaml`
- Git state at run time:
  branch `exp/tase-ur10e-v0-paper-audit`, no initial commit yet, dirty tree
  with untracked migrated files.
- Tracked lightweight artifacts:
  `metrics.yaml`, `metrics.json`, `fig5_r-sweep_20260524T011145.png`
- Ignored raw artifact:
  `fig5_r-sweep_raw.npz`
- Result:
  completed with expected `pending_pdf_verify` warning.

### UR10e MuJoCo smoke

- Run: `runs/ur10e_smoke/20260524T011145`
- Command:
  `python3 scripts/run_ur10e_mujoco_adaptation.py --config configs/mujoco_ur10e.yaml --smoke`
- Git state at run time:
  branch `exp/tase-ur10e-v0-paper-audit`, no initial commit yet, dirty tree
  with untracked migrated files.
- Tracked lightweight artifacts:
  `metrics.yaml`, `metrics.json`, `ur10e-smoke_contact-force_20260524T011145.png`,
  `ur10e-smoke_tcp-z_20260524T011145.png`
- Ignored raw artifact:
  `ur10e-smoke_raw-state.npz`
- Result:
  completed as approximate MJCF smoke only, not controller validation.

## Full Paper MATLAB/RNN Run

### Selected migrated evidence

- Legacy run: `runs/full_paper_matlab/20260523T114034`
- Migrated:
  selected Markdown reports and PNG verification figures under
  `runs/full_paper_matlab/20260523T114034/worktree/RNN_F2/results/`, plus the
  artifact README.
- Reason:
  These files are lightweight enough for the initial ordinary Git commit and
  preserve the report links for Fig.5/Fig.6 evidence.
- Omitted:
  MATLAB source worktree files, `.mat` raw data, tarball snapshots, logs, and
  archive payloads.
- Current documentation:
  `reports/full_article_reproduction_report.md` summarizes the result and
  legacy paths.
- Future action:
  Decide whether to migrate selected MATLAB source, use Git LFS for raw
  artifacts, or preserve the legacy path as external provenance.
