# Controller Implementation Plan

## Scope

Implement the finite-time force-motion controller after math and simulation
contracts are testable.

## Assumptions

- The first implementation targets simulation only.
- Real-time UR10e execution is out of scope until the hardware gate passes.
- `qpsolvers` with `osqp` is the preferred first QP backend.

## Exact Files Touched

- Future: `src/tase_repro/controller.py`
- Future: `src/tase_repro/kinematics.py`
- Future: `src/tase_repro/contact.py`
- Future: `src/tase_repro/metrics.py`
- Future: `tests/*`

## Commands To Run

```bash
scripts/run_tests.sh
python3 scripts/run_fig5_r_sweep.py --config configs/paper_truth.yaml
python3 scripts/run_ur10e_mujoco_adaptation.py --config configs/mujoco_ur10e.yaml --smoke
```

## Expected Outputs

- Unit tests for finite-time dynamics, kinematics, contact sign, and QP
  constraints.
- Controller logs with slack, saturation, solver status, and task residuals.

## Pass/Fail Criteria

Pass:

- No controller output is clipped outside the QP without reporting.
- Infeasible QP states return a stop or fail status, not a silent command.

Fail:

- A trajectory plot is accepted without solver/status metrics.

## Rollback Point Or Recovery Command

Implement controller code behind tests. Revert the controller commit if tests or
smoke runs regress.

## Unresolved Risks

- Paper finite-time law details remain pending PDF verification.
- Numerical stiffness may require smaller integration steps.

## Next Executable Step

Extend the bounded least-squares contract into the first simulation-only
controller path, keeping all solver status and slack metrics visible.
