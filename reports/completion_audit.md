# Completion Audit

Date: 2026-05-24

Branch: `exp/tase-ur10e-v39-completion-audit`

## Objective Restatement

The goal is to manage the TASE finite-time force-motion reproduction as a
Git-backed project in `Mingdao007/reproduce-tase`, migrate and audit existing
UR10e/OnRobot/MuJoCo artifacts, maintain plans/logs/decision records, derive
the 7DOF paper method for UR10e 6DOF, verify MuJoCo baselines, run staged
simulations, obey the real-robot safety boundary, and finish with
evidence-backed audits.

The objective has two separate technical claim levels:

1. `paper_equivalent_full_staged_feasibility`: strict setup and trajectory
   gates. This is not achieved.
2. `ur10e_adapted_trajectory_after_relaxed_setup`: relaxed setup budget plus
   strict Stage B trajectory gate. This is achieved for the slowed tilted-plane
   E1-E4 simulation matrix only.

| Verify MuJoCo baseline | Smoke, force ladder, force-feedback, trajectory, tilted-plane, and staged reports in `reports/*`; run manifest lists artifacts | Done for approximate simulation baseline |
| Implement tests before trusting plots | `scripts/run_tests.sh` used throughout; latest v39 validation was `68 passed in 1.43s` | Done for current code |
| Run staged simulations | v29-v38 staged runs and reports; v33 slowed E1-E4 matrix; v35-v37 setup probes | Done |
| Separate UR10e adapted results from paper-platform reproduction | README claim boundary plus D043; relaxed label explicitly says not paper-equivalent | Done |
| Strict full staged feasibility | v33 strict full staged `0 / 4`; v35 setup gate `0 / 10`; v36 setup gate `0 / 10`; v37 terminal IK `0 / 65` | Not achieved |
| UR10e adapted relaxed simulation claim | v38 evaluation: relaxed setup `4 / 4`, trajectory feasibility `4 / 4`, adapted label `4 / 4`, strict full staged `0 / 4` | Achieved for slowed tilted-plane E1-E4 only |
| Hardware safety boundary | `plans/HARDWARE_GATE_SOP.md`; reports repeatedly state no motion/writes; no hardware commands were run in these iterations | Maintained |
| Hardware gate before real motion | Only SOP exists; no `reports/hardware_gate_report.md`; TCP/payload/force source unresolved | Not achieved |
| Finish with evidence-backed audit | This file maps the objective to evidence and gaps | Done for current state |

## Current Accepted Claim

The project can currently claim:

```text
UR10e adapted slowed tilted-plane E1-E4 simulation:
  trajectory-after-relaxed-setup pass count = 4 / 4
  strict full staged feasibility pass count = 0 / 4
  hardware readiness = false
```

Evidence:

- `reports/relaxed_setup_budget_report.md`
- `configs/ur10e_adapted_acceptance.yaml`
- `runs/relaxed_setup_budget_eval/20260524T111859/metrics.yaml`

## Missing Or Weakly Verified Requirements

- Strict paper-equivalent full staged feasibility is not achieved.
- Paper-faithful 7DOF Franka reproduction is not implemented as a separate
  executable line; current paper truth extraction and migrated MATLAB/synthetic
  evidence are not a full paper-platform reproduction.
- Section V `z0_source` remains `pending_pdf_verify` in
  `configs/paper_truth.yaml`.
- UR10e MJCF, 85 mm TCP guess, payload, CoG, and contact geometry remain
  approximate or unverified for hardware use.
- OnRobot/RTDE force-source reconciliation remains unresolved.
- Hardware gate report is not produced, and no real robot motion is authorized.
- The relaxed setup budget is an explicit adapted-simulation label, not a
  mathematical solution to the strict Stage A setup gate.

## Audit Conclusion

The overall goal is not complete. The repository is now in a strong
simulation-audit state for a UR10e adapted result, but it has not achieved
strict paper-equivalent full staged feasibility or hardware readiness.

Do not mark the active goal complete from the current evidence.

## Next Executable Step

Choose one of these before any real hardware work:

- close the remaining PDF truth gap for Section V `z0_source`;
- validate or replace the approximate TCP/contact model and rerun the terminal
  setup audit; or
- create a separate paper-faithful 7DOF executable reproduction line so the
  UR10e adapted result is not carrying the paper-platform claim.
